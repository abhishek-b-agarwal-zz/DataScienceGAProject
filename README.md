# DataScienceGAProject
This is the repositiory for GA Project Submission

The project aims at 

1. Predicting the similar items for the users based on their past activity. I will be using collaborative filtering techniques here.
2. Using spacy and sklearnt to do sentiment analysis.

The source for the dataset is [this](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/)

The dataset I will be working on is called **Ratings only** (for recommendation engine) and **Electronics 5-Core** (for NLP)

The data is easy to download and easier to work with thus saving time in cleaning and feature extraction.
